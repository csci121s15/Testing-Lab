***Question 1***
Three mistakes that can be made when using an array is forgetting that 0 is apart of the 
array, everything in the array has to be the same type, and make sure that all parts of 
the array are set to null.

***Question 2***
After one configuration of a Scoreboard for both getScore() and getAverage() in the 
instance of a class both methods would be empty, or no values. In an instance with a 
single mutation in getScore()there will be one value added, while getAverage() would still
be empty. In an instance with multiple mutations getScore() will have one added value for 
the amount of times that the mutation occurs. getAverage() will have a value at this 
point.

***Question 3***
What would a brand new instance of the class look like? 
It would be empty with no values because they haven't been assigned yet.
What is the simplest mutation possible for the class?
There is no simple mutation possible for this class at this point.
What else can we do to an instance of the class?

What are the boundary conditions for the class?
There are no boundary conditions, currently it is laced at 0 for testing.

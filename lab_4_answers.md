1. Three things that could go wrong when making an array include: passing the wrong type to the array, forgetting to increment the loop or incrementing wrong, or not giving each new scoreboard a different name.
2. With a new instance of the class, `Scoreboard` will be empty. With a single mutation, `Scoreboard` will have one name and one score. In an instance where there are 5 mutations, `Scoreboard` will have 5 names with five scores.
3. **Testing questions for `Range`:**
	1. A brand new instance of the class would be empty and would contain no values.
	2. The simplest possible mutaion possible would be adding one value to the range.
	3. In an instance of a class the only other things we can do is use query methods on them.
	4. The boundary conditions are numbers from 0 to > 10.

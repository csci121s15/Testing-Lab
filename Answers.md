# Testing Lab Answers

**Question 1:** For the array that would be used in ```Scoreboard```, three possible mistakes that someone could make are returning a name's position even though the array is empty, returning a number of high scores outside of the index, and adding a value to the array with the wrong type.

**Question 2:** ```Scoreboard``` is created for the first time and it's empty. A name and a score are added to the array. To mutate the array multiple times, names and scores are added or removed.

**Question 3:**
A brand new instance of the ```Range``` class would contain only the values of start and stop that were passed to it. Nothing is mutated in the class. The class can also return a boolean for if a value is within the range, return the width, min, or max, and return the intersection of two ranges. The boundary conditions are min and max.

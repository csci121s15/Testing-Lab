#Question 1:
 ** The first mistake that many developers can make is trying to fit two or more data types into an array. For example, putting an integer and a string together in the same array. Another mistakes is forgettin to order the scores from greatest to elast in the array. Usually in a array they tend to want everything organized. Lastly, the third problem could be that one will be using parellel rays instead of an object to record the scores and names.**







#Question 2:

**If a new scoreboard were to be created, then it would simply be a scoreboard with no values in it. If a single mutation were to occur to the scoreboard, then the scoreboard would be a scoreboard with one value and one name in it. If multiple mutations were to occur then the scoreboard would have multiple scores**

#Question 3: 
1. The instance would be empty with no values because they haven't been assigned to anything yet.

2. There isn't really a simple mutation possible for this class at this point.

3.There are no boundary conditions, currently it is laced at 0 for testing.
